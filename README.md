## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose housing project has built using advanced regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We have built the model using linear regression and ended up with overfitting.
- So we have built the model using Ridge and Lasso Regression.
- Lasso Regression provides the best results compared to Ridge Regression.
